## We sell khlav kalash, only [khlav kalash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NFv5IGP2uA) $2.99 per unit

For decades we've been selling khlav kalash on the street but now, we are preparing our biggest leap ever… Selling khlav kalash online!

* The app has a single model, "Order" which represents orders made by customers
* Customers can enter their billing details and pay using a bank card (in the "new" action).
* After finishing the payment process, a page with the ticket is show to the customer (the "permalink" action).
* There are two separated areas,
    - Customers are only authorized to execute "new", "create" and "permalink" actions
    - The rest of the CRUD actions are restricted to the admin user (seller) only. Those pages are protected by basic http authentication (user: `admin`, password: `password`)

We need to:

* Add an email format validation
* Set at least the following fields as mandatory: `first name, country, postal_code, email`
* Charge cards using Stripe Elements (https://stripe.com/docs/js/elements_object/create). As we are also charging EU customers it might be interesting to support Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). Stripe has a nice tutorial on how implement it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95qSebQrm5E

You can add any other resource you need to finish the task (new dependencies, columns, models …)
